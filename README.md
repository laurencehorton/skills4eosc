# Skills4EOSC WP 6.1: Mapping Professional Networks Search

This is intended to help with the searching for Open Science related professional networks by automating the search teams in a browser based on search string criteria and a country internet domain.

By default it is set to English language searches, using the DuckDuckGo search engine. Both can be changed with according to the user's wishes.

This is not a web scraping tool. It is just for searching. The results will still need browsing, appraisal, and selection.

It works for those with authorisation to access the Google sheet "Professional networks"

Search strings were created by:
* Mareike Buss (CBS/DeiC)
* Emily Thorsson Sch√∂ller (CBS/DeiC)
